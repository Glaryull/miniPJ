    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish, or cuttles, are marine <a href="#nowhere">molluscs</a> of the order Sepiida. They belong to the
        class Cephalopoda which also
        includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which is
        used
        for control of buoyancy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with
        which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest
        species,
        the giant cuttlefish (Sepia apama), reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.[2]
    </p>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopuses, worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators
        include
        dolphins, larger fish (including sharks), seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The typical life expectancy of
        a
        cuttlefish is about 1–2 years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent
        invertebrates.[3] Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.[3]
    </p>
    <p>
        The Greco-Roman world valued the cuttlefish as a source of the unique brown pigment the creature releases from
        its
        siphon when it is alarmed. The word for it in both Greek and Latin, sepia, now refers to the reddish-brown color
        sepia in English.
    </p>
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        "Cuttle" in "cuttlefish", sometimes called "cuttles",[4] is derived from the Old English name for the species,
        cudele. The word may be cognate with the Old Norse koddi (cushion) and the Middle Low German Kudel (rag).[5]
    </p>
    <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Over 120 species of cuttlefish are currently recognised, grouped into six families divided between two
        suborders.
        One suborder and three families are extinct.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

    <h2>Fossil record</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The earliest fossils of cuttlefish are from the end of the Cretaceous period,[6][7] represented by Ceratisepia
        from the Late Maastrichtian Maastricht Formation of the Netherlands.[8] Although the Jurassic Trachyteuthis was
        historically considered possibly related to cuttlefish,[9] later studies considered it to be more closely
        related to octopuses and vampire squids.[10]
    </p>
    <h2>Range and habitat</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and temperate ocean waters. They are
        mostly shallow-water animals, although they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).[11] They have
        an unusual biogeographic pattern; they are present along the coasts of East and South Asia, Western Europe, and
        the Mediterranean, as well as all coasts of Africa and Australia, but are totally absent from the Americas. By
        the time the family evolved, ostensibly in the Old World, the North Atlantic possibly had become too cold and
        deep for these warm-water species to cross.[12] The common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), is found in the
        Mediterranean, North and Baltic seas, although populations may occur as far south as South Africa. They are
        found in sublittoral depths, between the low tide line and the edge of the continental shelf, to about 180 m
        (600 ft).[13] The cuttlefish is listed under the Red List category of "least concern" by the IUCN Red List of
        Threatened Species. This means that while some over-exploitation of the marine animal has occurred in some
        regions due to large-scale commercial fishing, their wide geographic range prevents them from being too
        threatened. Ocean acidification, however, caused largely by higher levels of carbon dioxide emitted into the
        atmosphere, is cited as a potential threat.[14] Some studies suggest that ocean acidification does not impair
        normal embryonic development, survival rates or body size.

    <h2>Anatomy and physiology</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>cuttlebone</h3>
    <p>
        Unlike other cephalopods, cuttlefish possess a unique internal structure called the cuttlebone, a highly
        modified internal shell, which is porous and is made of aragonite. Except for spirula, they are the only coleoid
        cephalopods with a shell with a phragmocone divided into chambers separated by septa.[15] The pores provide it
        with buoyancy, which the cuttlefish regulates by changing the gas-to-liquid ratio in the chambered cuttlebone
        via the ventral siphuncle.[16] Each species' cuttlebone has a distinct shape, size, and pattern of ridges or
        texture. The cuttlebone is unique to cuttlefish, and is one of the features that distinguish them from their
        squid relatives.[17]
    </p>
    <h3>Visual system</h3>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes. The organogenesis and the final structure of the
        cephalopod eye fundamentally differ from those of vertebrates such as humans.[18] Superficial similarities
        between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes are thought to be examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish pupil
        is a smoothly curving W-shape.[19][20] Although cuttlefish cannot see color,[21] they can perceive the
        polarization of light, which enhances their perception of contrast. They have two spots of concentrated sensor
        cells on their retinas (known as foveae), one to look more forward, and one to look more backward. The eye
        changes focus by shifting the position of the entire lens with respect to the retina, instead of reshaping the
        lens as in mammals. Unlike the vertebrate eye, no blind spot exists, because the optic nerve is positioned
        behind the retina. They are capable of using stereopsis, enabling them to discern depth/distance because their
        brain calculates the input from both eyes.[22][23]
    </p>
    <p>
        The cuttlefish's eyes are thought to be fully developed before birth, and they start observing their
        surroundings while still in the egg. In consequence, they may prefer to hunt the prey they saw before
        hatching.[24]
    </p>
    <h3>Arms and mantle cavity</h3>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish have eight arms and two additional elongated tentacles that are used to grasp prey. The elongated
        tentacles and mantle cavity serve as defense mechanisms; when approached by a predator, the cuttlefish can suck
        water into its mantle cavity and spread its arms in order to appear larger than normal.[25] Though the mantle
        cavity is used for jet propulsion, the main parts of the body that are used for basic mobility are the fins,
        which can maneuver the cuttlefish in all directions.[26]
    </p>
    <h3>Suckers</h3>
    <p>
        The suckers of cuttlefish extend most of the length of their arms and along the distal portion of their
        tentacles. Like other cephalopods, cuttlefish have "taste-by-touch" sensitivity in their suckers, allowing them
        to discriminate among objects and water currents that they contact.[27]
    </p>
    <h3>Circulatory system</h3>
    <p>
        The blood of a cuttlefish is an unusual shade of green-blue, because it uses the copper-containing protein
        haemocyanin to carry oxygen instead of the red, iron-containing protein haemoglobin found in vertebrates' blood.
        The blood is pumped by three separate hearts: two branchial hearts pump blood to the cuttlefish's pair of gills
        (one heart for each), and the third pumps blood around the rest of the body. Cuttlefish blood must flow more
        rapidly than that of most other animals because haemocyanin carries substantially less oxygen than haemoglobin.
        Unlike most other mollusks, cephalopods like cuttlefish have a closed circulatory system.[28]
    </p>
    <h3>Ink</h3>
    <p>
        Like other marine mollusks, cuttlefish have ink stores that are used for chemical deterrence, phagomimicry,
        sensory distraction, and evasion when attacked.[29] Its composition results in a dark colored ink, rich in
        ammonium salts and amino acids that may have a role in phagomimicry defenses.[29] The ink can be ejected to
        create a "smoke screen" to hide the cuttlefish's escape, or it can be released as a pseudomorph of similar size
        to the cuttlefish, acting as a decoy while the cuttlefish swims away.[30]
    </p>
    <p>
        Human use of this substance is wide-ranged. A common use is in cooking with squid ink to darken and flavor rice
        and pasta. It adds a black tint and a sweet flavor to the food. In addition to food, cuttlefish ink can be used
        with plastics and staining of materials.[citation needed] The diverse composition of cuttlefish ink, and its
        deep complexity of colors, allows for dilution and modification of its color. Cuttlefish ink can be used to make
        noniridescent reds, blues, and greens,[31] subsequently used for biomimetic colors and materials.[citation
        needed]
    </p>
    <h3>Poison and venom</h3>
    <p>
        A common gene between cuttlefish and almost all other cephalopods allows them to produce venom, excreting it
        through their beak to help kill their prey.[32] Additionally, the muscles of the flamboyant cuttlefish
        (Metasepia pfefferi) contain a highly toxic, unidentified compound[3] as lethal as the venom of fellow
        cephalopod, the blue-ringed octopus.[33] However, this toxin is only found in the muscle and is not injected in
        any form classifying it as poisonous, not venomous.
    </p>
    <h3>Sleep-like behavior</h3>
    <p>
        Sleep is a state of immobility characterized by being rapidly reversible, homeostatically controlled, and
        increasing an organism's arousal threshold.[34][35]
    </p>
    <p>
        To date one cephalopod species, Octopus vulgaris, has been shown to satisfy these criteria.[36] Another species,
        Sepia officinalis, satisfies two of the three criteria but has not yet been tested on the third (arousal
        threshold).[35][34] Recent research shows that the sleep-like state in a common species of cuttlefish, Sepia
        officinalis, shows predictable periods[35] of rapid eye movement, arm twitching and rapid chromatophore
        changes.[34]
